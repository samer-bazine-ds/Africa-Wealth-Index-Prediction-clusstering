# Wealth Index Prediction in Africa üåç

##  Project Overview

This project aims to predict economic well-being in African countries using readily available geospatial and environmental datasets. Since household-level economic surveys are sparse and costly, we attempt to model a **wealth index** from open-access data sources, offering a scalable and sustainable way to estimate wealth across the continent.

## üéØ Objectives

- Predict a continuous **wealth index** ranging from 0 to 1 using regression models.
- Reclassify the target into **binary wealth classes** (rich vs poor) and perform classification.
- Perform both **unsupervised learning** and **supervised learning** to gain insights and build predictive models.
- Apply **model tuning and stacking** to improve performance.
- Ensure reproducibility and generalizability by only using continent-wide datasets.
